User databases
==============

Some reports store information about the last run in tables in user
databases.  They can be safely purged and excluded from backup, but
their structures must always exist.

To (re-)create these, run as user dbreps:

$ USERDB=p_dbreps
$ sql -u enwiki_p <<EOF
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS $USERDB.bullshit_reviewed_page_titles;
CREATE TABLE $USERDB.bullshit_reviewed_page_titles
(page_id int(8) unsigned PRIMARY KEY,
 lastreviewed TIMESTAMP NOT NULL);
EOF
