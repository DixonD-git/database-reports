** Query page titles in NS:1 that aren't redirects
*** SELECT page_title FROM page WHERE page_namespace = 1 AND page_is_redirect = 0;
** Grep for "archive_"
* Pages with _/ or /_
* User / user pages of users with 0 edits
** Filter out redirects
* User / user talk page redirects with zero incoming links
** RFBailey's subpage
* Subpages where the root page doesn't exist
** Need to figure out cases like Foo/bar/baz where only bar doesn't exist
* Plaintext (spam) user pages
** Run through appropriate filters too. ("founded by", etc.)
* "Populated category redirects"
** Need template list from Vega
* Templates that transclude themselves
** Query available somewhere in my queries directory
* Add report "Articles containing red-linked categories"
** Indefinitely on hold; too many results (~24,000)


-- Two helpful checks in queries
* If page is a subpage
* If page exists (when querying from logging table)
